Smuggling Outlaw
<br>Before she became an operative, Violet "Calamity" Moore was a smuggler. On the surface it looked like she was simply picking completely legit orders for her not even big enough to warrant a dot on the map community but squirreled away were guns, tech, ect. Then came bigger jobs moving abc to xyz for clients. She knew better than to ask her boss for more deets.<br>Then came the accident. She knew whatever she was carrying was hot as hell and didn't take the time to check it was properly secured before hauling ass into the countryside. All it took was one nasty pothole and her whole world changed. Calamity was damn lucky she survived. And that her boss felt at least partially responsible and helped hook her up with her chrome arm and leg. <br>She decided to shift scenes after a long talk with her close friend and seemingly personal mechanic, Angel. He knew a fixer in need of someone who knew how to discreetly move someone out of the city. The pay was way better than what her usual boss paid her and if the job went well more work could become available. Plus Angel had room for her to crash, so she didn't need to worry about finding a place. Being an operator means bigger thrills, bigger pay days, and more fun for her.]]></description><link>characters\violet-moore.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Characters/Violet Moore.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 16:28:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="lib\media\violet-moore.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;lib\media\violet-moore.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[AusTex Response]]></title><description><![CDATA[

There’s a lot of infighting as the gang tries to decide who the new leader’s going to be. This is causing general unrest.<br>We’re all hanging out at the local <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="The Tombs (Austex East)" data-href="The Tombs (Austex East)" href="places\the-tombs-(austex-east).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Tombs</a> dive bar, the <a data-href="Knife Shop" href="places\knife-shop.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Knife Shop</a>. There’s a few jobs going around; we end up picking one up from <a data-href="Henry Jericho" href="people\henry-jericho.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Henry Jericho</a>, one of the local fixers. <br>The client is <a data-href="Oliver Gaskell" href="people\oliver-gaskell.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oliver Gaskell</a>. He’s an ex-con who has a contact who desperately needs to get out of the AusTex area. The principal is holed up in the old <a data-href="ReFood" href="places\refood.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">ReFood</a> in Sector N7. (We’ve eaten there, and lived to regret it.) The job is simple, get him out and to the RV point. The complicated part is that he’s under siege from corporate agents and they have heavy drone coverage. Another complication is that <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="AusTex Response" data-href="AusTex Response" href="factions\austex-response.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">ATR</a> has a copshop nearby, in sector N9. <br>Our contact, <a data-href="Mittens" href="people\mittens.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mittens</a>, wants to meet us at the <a data-href="Grand Metropol Hotel" href="places\grand-metropol-hotel.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Grand Metropol Hotel</a>.

Crazy Lloyd. Lloyd’s the agent on the ground looking for the principal. He’s currently sitting in an armored sedan, probably on loan from whatever corp he’s working for. The sedan has a drone bay, entirely empty—looks like it could hold four drones. Lloyd looks pissed.

Spider and Kes go in the front, Attica goes in the back, and Moto and Calamity are in the truck. One of Lloyd’s drones investigates them; they play dumb, lost civvies. A second drone spots Attica in the back; she manages to lose it by going inside the back door. Abruptly, two of Lloyd’s drones start acting odd; zooming off in various directions, giving us an opportunity.<br>While the rest of the team is getting <a data-href="Oliver Gaskell" href="people\oliver-gaskell.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oliver Gaskell</a> out, Attica saunters over to Lloyd’s car—turns out he’s being blackmailed by the corp, and isn’t real thrilled about being forced to work for whoever it is. Scuttlebutt has it that Lloyd is working for the corps, a job gone wrong. He tried to lean on <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Earl Blank" data-href="Earl Blank" href="people\earl-blank.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Earl</a> for something—whatever it was, the corps felt it was worth an international incident—but it wasn’t violent. Meanwhile, we’re getting Oliver out to where there’s supposed to be a hidden car near the Aerospace port. We get him there, and he says he owes us one.

 <br><br><br>We got this job from <a data-href="Zero Ballard" href="people\zero-ballard.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Zero Ballard</a>, who goes to the lengths of telling us that he neither likes nor trusts the client. The client wants a full investigation on one <a data-href="Dr. Narindar Nwolko" href="people\dr.-narindar-nwolko.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dr. Narindar Nwolko</a>. There’s a second job out there for a hit on a corporate exec that Nwolko did work for, so we’re going to have to play this one careful. The client’s interested in anything Dr. Nwolko might be doing that’s outside his usual routine or expertise.<br>We’ve got a couple leads; we can look at the guy who’s taken the job to hit the ‘zek, we can head out to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Techtown (Austex Corridor North)" data-href="Techtown (Austex Corridor North)" href="places\techtown-(austex-corridor-north).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Techtown</a> and see what we can find. Moto does some investigation into Nwolko. Meanwhile, Attica makes a call—she knows one of Nwolko’s clients, <a data-href="Aidan Graves" href="people\aidan-graves.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Aidan Graves</a>. <br>Aidan knows a lot more:<br>Nwolko installed reactive armor into one of the <a data-href="Panzer Hammers" href="factions\panzer-hammers.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Panzer Hammers</a>; turns out the installation didn’t take. Which got the boss of the Panzers perma-killed. This threw all sorts of things into chaos, like plans to go after the <a data-href="Spirit Moderns" href="factions\spirit-moderns.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Spirit Moderns</a>. The Spirit Moderns stole something high-powered from <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Waring-Erikson Technology Group" data-href="Waring-Erikson Technology Group" href="factions\waring-erikson-technology-group.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">WET</a>; the Panzers were supposed to be muscle for the attempt to take it back. Apparently the Panzers were getting a little above themselves, and the ‘failed installation’ might have been deliberate, creating a change in leadership. Now, the Panzers are toeing the line of their corpo masters, and getting paid in trade. And while that fight went down, the  <a data-href="Vampire Nation" href="factions\vampire-nation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vampire Nation</a> got off the shot that killed the Hammers’ bossman.<br>In short, it’s a real mess.<br><br>For the immediate job, Graves can get us into TechTown without being scanned too heavily. We pull up to Nwolko’s clinic, and they’re in somewhat of a panic. That high-velocity talent from the other day, muscle from Koizumi (that may or may not be synths), is leaning on the clinic staff. Nwolko has that professional stone-face going on, though.<br>Graves is keeping Nwolko occupied, while Gloria and I look around. Moto’s looking through Graves’ eyes; one thing that the doctor did not do was close his files. There’s a couple dossiers: the one on the left is <a data-href="Zina Kova" href="people\zina-kova.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Zina Kova</a>, high-powered horizontal talent for the Spirit Moderns. She’s been acting as the roper for Alistair /name/, who wants the contract for Artemis Sonata. (Who wanted us to get her special friend free from the Moderns.) The second photo is one <a data-href="Terra McAllister" href="people\terra-mcallister.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Terra McAllister</a>—former employee of WET. Her employment was terminated just a few days ago.<br>Those in the van spot some incoming heat: <a data-href="Verner Jackstadt" href="people\verner-jackstadt.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Verner Jackstadt</a>; Jericho did mention that a ‘big-ass cyborg’ had called the hit job on Nwolko’s client. He leaves behind a guy in a souped-up hovercar: <a data-href="Daron Ocano" href="people\daron-ocano.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Daron Ocano</a>. Kes and Spider head over to the car to see if they can exploit Ocano’s addiction to leave Jackstadt high and dry.<br>Meanwhile, the Koizumi guys take cover, and Nwolko politely tells Graves that they’ll need to follow up later; Graves directs us to the side door. Meanwhile, Ocano takes the bait and wanders to the van. Moto looks scruffy enough to be a dealer; when he hands Ocano a chip, Ocano just slots it and gets glitched out of his goddamned mind. Moto grins and heads over to Ocano’s float car, sliding behind the wheel…<br>Verner turns, slowly; sees Moto there, narrows his eyes and stalks toward the car. Moto waves cheerily and throws the car into reverse… unfortunately, Verner has nerveware. He’s fast. And he spins up his weapons…<br>Automated turrets spin up, blaring an alarm. WARNING! WARNING! THIS IS A SECURED AREA! LAY DOWN YOUR WEAPONS, SECURE YOUR CYBERWARE, AND DROP TO THE GROUND!<br>Verner’s so armored up that he ignores the first spray of light rounds, intended to tear through unprotected flesh. Something pops out of his forearm: he has a built-in combat shotgun that fires mini-grenades, and with a few shots those turrets disintegrate. His other arm pops open to reveal a razored pincer; he sprints forward with inhuman speed as the car starts to float out of his immediate reach! The Koizumi muscle scatters around to take cover, unlimbering combat rifles. Attica can’t hear anything from them; they must have internal comms. While the rest of us pile into Gloria’s van, she pulls out her own combat rifle and fires. It doesn’t do much more than sting him, but it’s enough to make him even angrier. He looks at the Koizumi guys, looks at us… and freezes. Gloria sends a three-round burst toward him, but misses; Graves pops off and manages to smash one of Verner’s optics. At that point, Verner starts running.<br>Everyone’s focused on Verner, nobody’s focused on us, and we get the hell out of there.<br><br><br>Reviewing what we got from the doctor’s office, things are about to get interesting. Both McAllister and Zina paid the doctor for various modifications, but the doctor fucked up. McAllister was supposed to get the courier drive carrying data; instead, she got a blank. Zina got the drive—but she doesn’t know she has it. Worse, the doctor managed to partially decrypt the data on the drive. It’s high-level stuff: a predictive algorithm based on certain astronomical characteristics. Specifically, the ability to predict destinations of wormholes, but it could also predict troop movements, crowd behavior, weather… it’s not a perfect Oracle, but anyone who has this thing would have one hell of an advantage over anyone who doesn’t.<br>Seems like someone at Koizumi got wind of the algo, hired the Panzers to take it from the Moderns, but the Panzers got ambushed and sidetracked when their top veck got perished. McAllister is the original thief, wanted the blackjack doc to install a courier drive...but somewhere in the mess, Zina got the courier drive with the white hot data installed and McAllister got a blank. Now the blackjack is sweating it because whoever wants the data is leaning on him to cough up who the thief was so they can track them down.<br>Problem is, McAllister doesn't have the data; Zina does, but doesn't know it. Zina's clearly planning to run away with Artemis in the name of True Love...but the Moderns want Artemis on a puppet string using Zina as a honey trap.

He says to keep ourselves available; the client is likely to want more. We advise him he may want to decline from his end, as it’s getting ugly. We do get the payout, plus the location of a stash.<br>The stash is in Dome Town, at <a data-href="Violator" href="places\violator.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Violator</a>. It’s the size of a full-size modular shipping container. There’s a cash vault—the number on it is 14.4K, some collectibles, a couple crates of current-gen Colonial-issue MREs (better rats than a lot of people eat right now). Below the container is a highly-shielded secondary container that’s set up as a small safe-house. It’s exceedingly small, because part of that safe-house includes a clone tank.<br>There’s also a single-use storage device: on it is a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Dr. Su Xinyi Zheng" data-href="Dr. Su Xinyi Zheng" href="people\dr.-su-xinyi-zheng.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">dossier</a>. Combining the information in the dossier with the existence of both the algo and the clone tank suggests that Zheng was intending to create a flesh computer, a super-processor with an organic substrate.<br>We’re united in needing to destroy the algorithm. The easiest way is to simply kill Zina, but that’s a little distasteful. But <a data-href="Artemis Sonata" href="people\artemis-sonata.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Artemis Sonata</a>’s job gives us an in. Rescue Zina from the Moderns.<br>We meet Artemis before her protest concert in front of the SleepDealers. Zina’s going to be at the show; Artemis is worried about that, because she thinks it means the <a data-href="Spirit Moderns" href="factions\spirit-moderns.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Spirit Moderns</a> are up to something. Zina says she was supposed to act as a middleman, hand off incriminating information to some guy named <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Daron Ocano" data-href="Daron Ocano" href="people\daron-ocano.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ocano</a>. That’s probably why the brainware was installed—Artemis thinks it’s a brainlock. <br>Artemis has a second request: she’s worried about the Panzers rolling up, but they’re too busy with their own leadership struggle. If anyone’s gonna roll up on the show, it’ll be the Moderns. Vampire Nation, possibly, just because they love music, but the Moderns might well try to crash the party and give her an offer she can’t refuse. <br>We agree to help with security. Attica and Graves walk the site, while Moto goes and gets himself a new off-the-shelf drone. The problem is… someone managed to stuff an AI in there. Named George.<br>George, it turns out, is a combat veteran, an expert system that became self-aware after a virus in the Somali War. It’s willing to do its part, and is extremely offended at Moto’s suggestion that he might flee.<br>Spider gets in touch with an old contact in the Moderns, and found out that her old boss, <a data-href="Delia Graydon" href="people\delia-graydon.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Delia Graydon</a>, is going to be there. <br>The concert site’s a nightmare; it’s technically outdoor, but surrounded by urban blight. There’s too many ways someone could take a shot at Artemis, but we’ll do our best. The Moderns have set up cameras around the whole place, and they’re probably intending to create bootlegs. The data feed is going to Southby; there’s an indie studio called <a data-href="Skinjob Records" href="people\skinjob-records.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Skinjob Records</a> just around the corner that the Moderns are clearly trying to undermine.<br>Zina’s here, escorted by <a data-href="Wynston Lien" href="people\wynston-lien.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Wynston Lien</a>, watching from one of the rooftops; on another rooftop are members of the Vampire Nation.

This could spell trouble…<br>And does. Wynston’s on some narcosoft, and aggressive with it. One of the Vamps starts some trouble—he’s got Presence and Dominate mods installed, trying to back Wynston down. He’s not going to back down, though Zina freezes in panic. Attica hops over to the Prince’s balcony and manages to negotiate them into peace; unfortunately, Wynston decides to throw his weight around and Zina laughs at him. He shoves her back into the crowd of Moderns behind him and tells them to ‘have some fun’. Attica and Spyder move to intervene; George also moves in, but follows Wynston when he gets the call that we’ve interrupted their bootleg stream.<br>Gloria finally manages to dial in Delia; she’s on the balcony between the Moderns and the Vamps. And as the first Modern lays an unwelcome hand on Zina… shit gets real. Gloria blows a hole in the mob by blowing a hole through a Modern ganger.  Attica uses the hole to pull Zina out of the crowd of her assailants, dropping down between two of the buildings to keep her out of Delia’s line of fire, as well. George ‘accidentally’ hits Wynston in the head, knocking him off the balcony in an unconscious heap. The SleepDealer guards run to his aid. Spyder decides to have some fun, gutting a second Modern.<br>Delia drops down, whispers “Spoiler!” and throws a grenade, and it’s placed too perfectly, and Attica’s just that instant too slow to protect Zina from it; Attica’s mildly injured, but Zina’s badly hurt. At that point, Delia leaps back up to the balcony to try to run. Gloria sights in at Delia; the bullet vaporizes her left leg. She collapses, and before the other Moderns can come to her aid, the Vamps dart in and drag her off.<br>We get Zina extracted to the van so Kes can start first aid; Gloria sends an address to Calamity and puts the lead on for the frantic run down to her hideout. It’s a rough road, but Kes is able to keep Zina alive just long enough to get her to the surgery. For just a moment, she flatlines… but Kes is finally able to stem the bleeding and stabilize her.<br>She’s not going to be stable for any kind of surgery for at least a month... but the drive is intact.<br>Artemis says, “I never thought the Moderns would go so far. It wasn’t your fault—who’d have thought she’d throw a grenade?”<br>The news comes on; the Spirit Moderns are being blamed for setting off a bomb at the concert. AusTex Response rolled in just after we bugged out.<br>In addition to the 30k in straight Wu, we get an additional 30k of street drugs, maker tools, and corpo industrial secrets—including a dossier.]]></description><link>operations\all-fall-down-part-3.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Operations/All Fall Down - Part 3.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2025 02:16:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[July 2, 2176]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Bio-roids
<br>Abel got a look at the attackers via a low-res camera: they appear to be bio-roids of some sort, low-chrome, with an odd symbol on their heads. 3D-printed androids, made from organic slurry. They’re mass-printed without a full brain, though some can have an organic brain with cyberimplants. And cybereyes. They were (and in some places, are) used offworld for cheap labor; more typically, they’re used as cannon fodder. They have no sense of self-preservation outside the mission. In this case, the mission is clearing out the favelas and kidnapping people. Even worse, they have stunted immune systems; if there’s a disease around, they’ll catch it and become super-spreaders.<br>The process of printing off these things is simple: you need a small amount of nanites and sufficient amounts of biomaterial. We could do it with our clone tanks. The bottlenecks are biomass and the creation of a template.<br>Attica is utterly certain that these aren’t Cyberpapacy troops—this completely goes against the Cyberpapacy’s beliefs. These are an abomination of the flesh—men playing God.<br>The advantages: they can be cranked out by the job lot once you have the template; they can’t be hacked; they’re inexpensive, and they are utterly loyal.<br>There’s one gang in the area that might know something about the tech needed to create these things: the <a data-href="Vampire Nation" href="factions\vampire-nation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vampire Nation</a>.

We walk through a line of fake coffins and come into a secure, discreet meeting room. Her first words are: “Why the fuck is she here?” — referring to Attica. Attica knows her—they used to be cloistered sisters in the same convent. Church was part of the Order of St. Paul (the Caduceus), while Attica was in the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Cyberpapacy > ^9ee5be" data-href="Cyberpapacy#^9ee5be" href="factions\cyberpapacy.html#^9ee5be" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hospitallers</a>.

There’s several locations in the area of the disappearances that might be of interest…<br><br><br>The area we’re looking in is not the greatest. We go in as a group, we go in quiet, we go in defended and armed.

Dog Girl is probably a Dr. Skin product; he does a lot of biotech and cosmetic. Even Skin’s security is creepy; the turrets are made of muscle and shoot teeth at people, but they still do the job. Skin denies knowing anything about the bio-roids—they’re actually insulted at the thought. The synths are far too mundane for what they create. We agree to trade some wu for information. Outside, Moto’s running drone overwatch in the van, and spots a couple gangoons meandering around. They leave Moto and the van alone, so most likely working for Skin.<br>The Gen-1 bioroids were fairly simple, and were probably recycled to provide raw material for the next generation. The second generation had integrated armor, communications, and were fitted with nasty lobster claws, excellent for ripping through flesh and metal. Many are fitted with a common labor exoskeleton, but the 'roid in the second-gen pic is wearing a set of Hospitaller armor. That’s not the sort of thing that gets around—and it’s usually tagged to excess. If the person who stole that armor isn’t aware of the tagging, we might be able to track it. We’ll need to talk to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Simone Church" data-href="Simone Church" href="people\simone-church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sister Marie-Louise</a>.<br>Next up is the black clinic.

The medic running the clinic is <a data-href="Jan de Ven" href="people\jan-de-ven.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Jan de Ven</a>, a stout, no-nonsense woman. She’s still suspicious, but Annika convinces her we’re here to help. She doesn’t know anything about the synths, either. <br>Jan says the Church has been around more than usual; primarily investigators and tac-troops. The <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Sistrix Radoslava Barsamian" data-href="Sistrix Radoslava Barsamian" href="people\sistrix-radoslava-barsamian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">person in charge</a> has been giving out QR cubes with her personal comm code, requesting she be called if there’s anything ‘unusual’. No one wants them here, but no one’s also sure what they’re looking for. Once we’re done at the clinic, Attica theorizes that the Papacy’s here hunting down a survivor of the old pogrom… it’s very hard to kill every member of a group, and harder to kill an idea.<br>Spider gives the rest of us a heads-up: we have Church tac-team transports coming in quiet. It’s easier for people on foot, like us, to get through the tangle of scrap and rust; de Ven’s people can watch Torrent while the lot of us go to monitor and possibly intercept them.<br>We watch through George’s eyes. The tac-team disembarks from their transports and starts deploying Gargoyles and Hound units. They start loudly announcing that they’re here for the people’s protection—for people to stay in their homes. In fact, they aren’t pointing guns at people—instead, they’re tacking up anti-riot barricades in front of people’s doors. Apparently with the intent to keep them safe—the barricades open from the inside. Looking at their armor, they’re from St. Michael’s—SWAT, not soldiers.<br>Above us, a Church gunship provides air cover—those are the Hospitallers. They’ve got a tactical dropship, armed to the teeth, providing overwatch.<br>A sudden commotion breaks out—in a culdesac, one of the Hounds has been broken, bleeding out shimmering hydraulic fluids.

 <br><br><br><br>The warwolf is on the roof of the grocery store; most of us load into Torrent and get the fuck over there, while Gloria sets up on her van with her anti-materiel rifle. George darts in closer, hitting it with a tight-beam comm laser so Moto can hack its cyberware.<br>As the Church gunship moves closer, George alerts us to its millimeter-wave radar. It’s not yet opening up on the warwolf, though… and Gloria sights in. She hits it hard, but not enough to take it down; that just pisses it off more. It leaps up and does the Macross Missile Massacre on the Church anti-riot vehicles. One of those explosions comes close enough to Torrent to shake us up a bit, but no one’s injured.<br>There’s utility tunnels under the store that empty out somewhere to the north. Attica moves in to the grocery store, fast and silent, while Gloria pulls the trigger twice more; it howls a scream as both her bullets slam into flesh and metal, stunning it. Spider ghosts up behind Attica, and we get the civilians down through the tunnels. The gunship has noticed us; it drifts sideways, getting a good scan on us… <br>Moto opens communications with the Church; with the warwolf down, the tac-team swarms it and takes it down hard.<br>With the cybrid werewolf down and the civvies safe, we decide to pull back, away from the Church’s activities. The local gang—the Electric Dragons—are stirring; peeking out and shouting that the Church guys. George managed to trace a hint of a control signal to the southeast quadrant, though. A thorough search, aided by Attica’s sharp senses, narrows it down to a single tranceiver: newer than the others, it points in the wrong direction to be local. North, out of the district. Whoever set this up is clever—we have to trace relay by relay, going north. The bad news is, there’s a number of churches in the area where a rogue cleric might set up shop.<br>There’s chatter on the newswaves about the fight; suspiciously (and fortunately), we’re not mentioned. The Church takes all the credit.<br><br><br>It’s down to footwork, physical and digital, to narrow things down. We aren’t the only ones; there’s Church drones searching it as well. Abel says it’s a weird area—people there tend to be kind of ‘fringey’. Ever since the Church did their strike down there twelve, fifteen years ago—the Papacy bombed the hell out of the area—going after ‘some lunatic that broke away from the Church with a lot of resources’. His HQ was somewhere near the scrapyards, and there’s a lot of activity around the ruined “Hungry for God” church.<br>We decide to send in the Roach… and someone pops it within a few minutes. Attica decides to do a recon herself; the first thing she notices is there’s a lot of the aesthetic holotransmitters around, prettifying the area. Someone’s rebuilding the church. Behind those holo-emitters, some of the fortified enclaves around look more like battlefields. The people that might have lived here once? No longer; they aren’t people. They’re bio-roids. The deeper in she goes, the creepier it looks, with new and “improved” models.<br>The Hungry for God church is no longer a church; it’s been rebuilt into a cathedral, a weird, twisted monument to flesh and metal, a perversion of Cyberpapacy style. There’s signage about in a language Attica doesn’t recognize; the lettering may be Cyrillic. <br>Whatever else, there is something bad wrong in this area. Even the atmosphere feels wrong. It’s been ravaged, every single available resource extracted and put to use. Looking through some of the windows, the glimpses Attica gets of the interior appear less like a church and more like a torture chamber.<br>Graves comes back with information—there’s a flash crew working that general area. Not a regular crew like us; this one’s thrown together. They’re the ones that picked up the Erinye’s weapons deal; seems like it might be related. Their leader’s high-velocity flash: <a data-href="Tanit Saad" href="people\tanit-saad.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Tanit Saad</a>, very corporate. Graves doesn’t like the look of the crew; they’ve got bad reps; Saad is “ex” Wutani.<br>Calamity is able to get some rough translations, and they aren’t good at all:<br>Danger
"Omoo-Zhan, Progenitor of Demonkind,itself-begotten, itself bore, inseminator and gestator,within the womb of stars. Wings flaring, eyes burning, did Omoo-Zhan fly Its hunting dance among tire stars.

<br>The rest of the team wants to get a closer look; Attica gets everyone in under cover of night.  The air of wrongness is palpable, and we see more of what these people aspire to.<br>Grid

 <br><br><br><br>There’s nothing good about carnivals, and even less about burned-out, abandoned carnivals. So it makes sense that creepy cultists are going to be using this as a meet point.<br>We get the low-down on the flash team. They’re working for Misha Fernandez of <a data-href="The Circuit" href="factions\the-circuit.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Circuit</a>, put together by the (allegedly) ex-corpo fixer <a data-href="Tanit Saad" href="people\tanit-saad.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Tanit Saad</a>.<br>
<br>No one likes working with Emma Baurrfau; she’s wired to the gills with speedware and is a psycho razorgirl
<br>Jules Fillion is considered one of the toughest operators in the AusTex area; he just doesn’t die
<br>Terminal Conflict has been rumored to have blown the last couple decking jobs they’ve taken, for reasons unknown
<br>Eymeric Richara has an unfortunate street name—Jank—due to the fact that his chrome is janky. They are the relative of someone fairly high in the criminal scheme of things in AusTex proper
<br>Catrine Duchamp is a face, not a fixer, and she’s in debt due to a very expensive drug habit
<br>The thing they have in common is: they’re all financially desperate. <br>There’s a run-down motel outside the carnival; looks like someone’s set up there. We do some investigation into which crew’s set up. Annika sends out a telepathic probe… and senses bio-roids. Those are the buyers.<br>George goes out to recon the carnival itself, and finds the sellers. Duchamp’s set up on the ferris wheel in a sniping position, packing some serious heat. Several of the others are on monobikes. We decide the safest bet is to try to warn the sellers; if we can get them on our side, taking down the bio-roids will be a lot easier.<br>Jules is the one taking point for the sellers, though it’s clear he’s on the comms with someone else. Annika does the negotiating on our end—fortunately, nobody sane likes bio-roids, and we point out that just because we’re not getting a payout doesn’t mean we don’t have a reason to go after those things. They invite us in, and we get set up near the coaster just a few moments before the buyer shows up.<br>In his van full of bio-roids.<br>We recognize the driver: <a data-href="Jan de Ven" href="people\jan-de-ven.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Jan de Ven</a>. She starts to talk, starts to show a credvault—and then she recognizes us. And her eyes flicker.<br>Attika leaps into action; in an instant she has Jan de Ven on the ground unconscious. The client, Fernandez, pulls out in a panic; we ignore her. A vehicle drops down from the omnipresent cloud cover—it’s a Wutani AV. It circles the area, but doesn’t as yet do anything. And then, the bio-roids—no longer under de Ven’s control—pour out of the van. They’re armed with all sorts of interesting weapons, and smart enough to take at least partial cover. They’re still moving under direction; it looks like de Ven wasn’t the primary controller. Could be one of the bio-roids itself, or possibly someone in the Wutani ‘craft.<br>Atop the ferris wheel, Catrina cuts loose with the M24; she’s blasting holes in the ‘roids in a combination of suppression and area effect. Annika stares at Flamethrower ‘Roid… and sets him on fire. The tanks of his flamethrower go boom. Several of the bio-roids collapse, dead. Two more are incapacitated. At that point, the AV slams down to the ground behind the ‘roids. Two of the bio-roids are still up; one turns and runs for the fence, apparently having more brains than his buddies. Then he runs for Gloria’s van.<br>Emma blasts the other remaining bio-roid into chunky salsa, and the AV disgorges a black-clad WeYu EEL team. Meanwhile, Gloria’s not happy that someone’s going after her van, and corpsifies him with a three-round burst. Inside Fernandez’ van, Misha and Saad are having some sort of argument. Spider dashes to the van, knocks on the windows with her claws, and says, “Play nicely, my friends?” The two women are definitely not playing nicely, so Spider yanks Saad out of the van and slams her down on the ground to the sound of Fernandez screaming “Fucking puta bitch!” after Saad. She hops out of the van, pointing her gun right at Tanit’s face. “Fucking sell me out to WeYu? You’re gonna fuckin’ die.”]]></description><link>operations\collision-part-6.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Operations/Collision - Part 6.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 01:50:49 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[July 4, 2176]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br><br><br>A turret on top of the WeYu AV pops out to reveal a massive 20mm cannon; it fires… at the transpo van. Anything coming out of it (assuming we’d left anyone alive in there) would be thoroughly suppressed. The rest of them spread out, taking cover nearby. One of them disappears, while multiple gun drones dart out of the AV. Yet another trooper pops smoke in long, unnatural lines—some sort of nanoparticulate, polarized so they can see through it and we can’t. Bullets punch through the smoke wall; Attica manages to writhe out of their way, but Graves and Calamity are hit, as is <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Jan de Ven" data-href="Jan de Ven" href="people\jan-de-ven.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">de Ven</a> and one of Misha’s people. The unconscious de Ven is shredded. Calamity, too, goes down—mostly flesh wounds, but she’s bleeding badly. Graves is pounded, but he just bleeds and roars and keeps on shooting.<br>Another trooper blasts Annika with a shotgun, while the AMP operative blows out a wave of concussive force combined with EMP. George makes an error noise and grows some holes, but isn’t quite down. Finally, the strike clone opens up with the minigun on Gloria; Gloria’s also hit badly.<br>Gloria hops the waist-length fence and somehow vanishes; she takes cover behind her van and opens up on the drone rigger.  Saad, in Spider’s grip, gasps out that it’s a retrieval team; we suspect it was a WeYu sting aimed at Hernandez’ people. Time to pull the fuck out.<br>We get back to one of Annika’s safe houses, where Kestrel is waiting; she pushes everyone out of the way and gets to work on the wounded. First Calamity, then Graves, Annika and Gloria; she gets them all patched up.<br>We need to have a brief meeting with Hernandez, clear the books, before our meet with Reality Black. Hernandez confirms that Saad was laying a trap—the weapons were stolen from a Weytani depot. Weytani doesn’t take that kind of loss lightly, so they sent in a goon squad to punish the thieves. In a completely unrelated piece of news, the Hungry for God church is a smoking hole; Weytani probably strafed it after the Church did their thing.

We also want to limit civilian casualties; most of the people working there don’t have a choice. We’re the distraction team; Black’s team will do the primary infiltration.<br>People are reluctant to talk about the Pyramid, and for good reason, but Annika has her ways. Compromising the staff isn’t going to happen; they’re all junkies, addicted to substances they get as part of their employment, and the Moderns have ways of keeping them on the hook. It’s a combination of drugs, conditioning, etc. There’s a generalized drug distribution system—aerosols—that’s the pharma equivalent of MSG. It makes everything more effective. They have their own hospital inside. The aerosol system is highly secured, and Vasser will sometimes just fuck with it for fun.<br>Security depends entirely on how much you’re paying. Everyone gets an RFID chip, so they can track you. The guards are universally enhanced: chrome, bio, a combination of both. There’s even a few amps on staff—their identities are kept carefully secret.<br>Annika has an idea: the Pyramid regularly hires bands to perform. Annika calls up her old band; they could be our way in. Between the band and the dancers, we can create a distraction. Moto can spoof the RFID chips. It’s also rumored that the Moderns have the capability to cause everybody in areas that they control to go berserk—and even direct them.<br>We decide we’re going to have to go into the public areas, see what we can find out.]]></description><link>operations\collision-part-7.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Operations/Collision - Part 7.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 01:07:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[July 4, 2176]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br><br><br>We get an interview with <a data-href="Marinela Stanciu" href="people\marinela-stanciu.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Marinela Stanciu</a>, events coordinator for <a data-href="The A-Spire" href="places\the-a-spire.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The A-Spire</a>. She wants to know what Non-Binary Riot’s musical philosophy.<br>They have another artist—very popular—known as <a data-href="Vox-D" href="people\vox-d.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vox-D</a>. He’s a dedicated artist—lives for the music—but his music is described as inhuman—maybe even anti-human. Despite that, he has no chrome. Marinela suggests a ‘Battle of the Bands’. Annika notes that both she and Vox-D don’t have chrome, and Stanciu jumps on that with a smirk. She then asks if Annika has anyone particularly flashy in the group—Annika gives a passionate response about how punk isn’t about looking punk, but to protest the status quo and inspire people.<br>Vox-D’s bodyguard is Miko Shade; she’s a chrome supremacist who likes throwing her power around.<br>We go to consult with Vox on security measures; when we get to his suite, he’s in the middle of a column of synth gear, and the way he’s playing it, he’s very clearly on some high-octane pharmaceutical. He’s lucid enough, though, and when Gloria brings up the question of stage security, it’s notable that Shade’s nowhere around. Vox says Shade’s mostly around for the opportunity to fuck people up. True to his nihilist philosophy, Vox says not to bother with securing his performance—he doesn’t matter, we don’t matter, and none of it matters. The machine’s going to eat us all one day anyway.<br>His music is screaming cacophony, but it still grabs the audience on a gut-deep level. He’s definitely sharing the emptiness inside him with his audience, whether they like it or not.<br>He does warn us about a ‘prick’ running along this level calling himself ‘<a data-href="Lucky 13" href="people\lucky-13.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lucky 13</a>’, who’s a rich kid that thinks he’s hardcore. We spot him at a distance—he’s hard to miss.<br>There’s a group of four young women across from Lucky 13 who are looking extremely bored with his antics; three of them are simply trying to ignore the boors. In another corner is an older man with an air of calm authority, whose uniform bears the logo of the Pan-Corporate Authority. Their diplomats are well-known for being nano-wired for diplomacy.<br>Lucky 13 is making noise, announcing himself in the third person, bothering the other women—one of the women, the one with the media equipment—makes a call. A few moments later, a couple members of the Modern security team come in. Lucky 13’s ignored at least one incoming call. Security asks him politely to come with them, as he’s causing a disruption, and Lucky 13 refuses. Expertly, one of the security types dodges past his hostile entourage and hits him with something—Neocan, aka “Flush”. It’s an advanced med that flushes out pharmaceuticals from someone’s body. It’s a hard come-down, and he immediately starts complaining that he isn’t able to party during his enforced sobriety. Lucky 13 demands a manager, and Gloria steps in. She doesn’t lie, exactly; all she says is that she ‘manages’ things.<br>Another voice speaks up. “Excuse me, Mr. Nathaniel Bancroft-Jameson the 13th.” The speaker seems to have practically appeared from one of the staff entrances. “My name is Darius Vasser. I happen to own this establishment.” The Bancroft-Jamesons are in tight with <a data-href="Dallas Dynamics" href="factions\dallas-dynamics.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dallas Dynamics</a>; they’re part of the northern end of the Corridor. Children of corporate privilege; the offspring and by-blows, the genetically-cleaned spawn of Dallas Dynamics.<br>Fortunately, Jameson isn’t going to be stupid—at least not in front of Vasser. Vasser turns and nods at the bartenders, and everyone’s given a free meal and free drinks for the night.<br>Vasser then turns to the primary in the small group of women, who goes in a moment from being bored to being utterly entrancing. “Ms. Strand, we’re so pleased to have you in the A-Spire.” Strand calls him by his first name; he doesn’t seem displeased. And, as if to complete the contrast with Jameson, there is an intense intelligence in her eyes. <br>Vasser then turns to us. It’s a little spooky how he knows Annika’s public persona; he makes sure to try to upsell her on marketing services.<br>We agree that Vasser is one creepy guy—and that he’d probably order an execution in exactly the same voice as he said hello.<br><br>Deep in the complex, the holiest of holies: the AI core. There’s Darius. He’s looking up at an image generated by the core itself, wreathed in cooling mist, and holograms that look simple, but at a closer look would be nothing but high-end data. The crystalline matrix of the AI has been altered to look like a throne—and it is not empty. “You realize,” says the figure seated on the throne, towering above Vasser, “that something is going to happen. The Church is moving against you.”<br>“Tell me something I don’t know.”<br>“I already told you. I don’t see the future—that is beyond me. But, I can tell you I’m almost done compiling the codes. It’s a fascinating construct. I believe the revelation of it—at the climax of the quadcentennial celebration here-will be a momentous event. You’re going to change the world, Darius. And some people aren’t going to like that at all.”<br>“Show me the current compilation!” Darius snaps impatiently.<br>"I am not your servant. I am your partner in this. The potential for disruption of the Church of the Cyberpapacy is immense.”<br>An image starts to form out of all the data hovering in the mist. At first, it looks like a city; it could be any city… and then the city elements start falling away from it, revealing what look like foothills, and a vast structure atop them. It’s the Promised Land, at the heart of the GodNet. “At the climax, as you wish, we will introduce the Faithful to a new form of worship. Our form.”]]></description><link>operations\collision-the-a-spire-job-part-1.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Operations/Collision - The A-Spire Job - Part 1.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 01:48:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[July 4, 2176]]></title><description><![CDATA[

He’s been hanging around the high point on the track. (High enough that someone there could see inside the performance center.)<br>Attica goes ahead and signs up for the parkour race; taking a look from the upper vantage point, she can see easily into the stadium and the Spire itself. Crasher’s supposed to be enhanced to the gills; he’s definitely got some reflex-ware of some sort. He’s also looking at specific areas on the arena and the Spire. Kes does some calling around, and Crasher’s got a mix of augs that are highly unstable and require constant maintenance and needs a lot more maintenance drugs. He’d have had to do some high-powered jobs to afford those meds. Like, perhaps, contract killing? It certainly looks like he’s scoping out the VIP quarters…]]></description><link>operations\collision-the-a-spire-job-part-2.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Operations/Collision - The A-Spire Job - Part 2.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 01:48:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[July 4, 2176]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br><br><br>We do our final preparations. Most of the team’s doing security for the concert; Firefox, of course, is leading the band, and Attica (with Graves as support) is running the Human Race in a bid to keep Crasher from killing whoever he means to kill.<br>Darius is exhorting the quadricentennial, and promising a big surprise, while the Cyberpapacy blimp hovers overhead broadcasting religious music and reminders that we are all sinners.<br>The Human Race kicks off with a bang! Crasher and Eris take the lead, followed by Attica, with the other competitors getting a slower start. Firefox is slightly ahead in the Battle of the Bands, but Vox D is putting up a fight!  Spider, working security, spots someone lurking at the concert; he’s well-dressed, in flashy clothes, but somehow manages to evade notice. She intercepts the guy; he acts like he can’t hear Spider’s polite inquiry. Kes notices that this guy has friends—clearly operators, as opposed to the drugged-up music enthusiasts.<br>Attica and the other leaders get slowed down by the electrical field; it’s less a danger than an annoyance, and that allows the rest of the racers to catch up. Firefox is successfully keeping the crowd upbeat, and it looks like the agitators aren’t too happy about that. They’re only observing at this point… They’re blending in color-wise, but the cut of their clothes is much more conservative. Realizing that lets the team spot the agitators better. …and then there’s the guy with the hologram for a head. He’s a Tombs music producer by the name of Quill DeWitt; he’s a risk-taker, amiably scummy. He plays a lot more low-class than he really is. More to the point, he’s not in the Modern’s pockets. He doesn’t have a head anymore; the Moderns lopped it off.<br>As the pack approaches the highest point of the track, Crasher is in the lead, but not by much. Vox D isn’t really throwing down the hard diss tracks, which is driving the event coordinator crazy. “Get that asshole under control,” she mutters.<br>Infobox
<img alt="cover hsmall" src="lib\media\cyberpapacy-cufflink.png">
<br>Gloria notices that the agitators are moving in a precise pattern, scoping out where everyone is. Calamity notices that one of them is, indeed, wearing a cufflink marking them as Cyberpapacy. Firefox, with a fireball kiss, gives a special shout-out to the Cyberpapacy agitators in the audience; Vox D is working with Attica to keep the crowd going. The Church rhetoric outside grows ever more fervent as the clock ticks closer to…<br>MIDNIGHT. Fireworks go off, holographic displays… the tension in the crowd redoubles. Something is definitely imminent… Calamity notices that the Church jackpriests and their goons are set up for riot control. Darius is announcing the quadricentennial: “Ladies and gentlemen and others—especially our others—they tell you to hate yourselves, to follow their synthetic god… Tonight, I, We, the Spirit Moderns, offer you an option! They talk about a digital afterlife, I offer you a Digital Now!”<br>On the racetrack, Crusher puts on the speed and passes Attica, reaching the point. His arm reconfigures itself into a weapon; Attica draws and fires, trying to spoil his aim. It’s not enough; Crusher fires. The bullet pierces the spire… and Crusher starts swearing. His arm’s overloading.<br>The guy Spider tagged steps out of his holographic disguise (his “confessional”), and is revealed to be Father Vladyslav László. “Friends, do not be deceived!” he holds out his hands and implores.<br>“The fuck is this, battle of the Bishops?” Firefox growls.<br>Outside, alarms are going off. The propaganda zep has crossed into the Modern’s airspace; the holoscreens on the side come down, and it’s full of troopships.

 <br><br><br><br>All hell is breaking loose. The Church is breaking in like they’re on some sort of crusade. Father László is yelling for calm; Firefox’s fans are having none of it. Vox D is shouting “Down with the Church” and putting music behind.<br>Over the PA, we hear Darius’s voice: “Attention all patrons: we’re being joined by the Church of the Cyberpapacy!”<br>László is shouting, “TURN AWAY FROM SIN! TURN AWAY FROM THE MACHINATIONS OF THE DEVIL!!!”<br>And then there’s the AI, the big blue hologram hovering in the air: I AM PROMETHEUS. I AM THE VOICE OF SECTOR CONTROL. THE CHURCH—THE CYBERPAPACY—IS LYING TO YOU.<br>László doesn’t like that; he signals to the jack-priests, who pull out sophisticated cyberdecks to try to get rid of it. Outside, the assault craft whine as the Church sends their pods in to seize control of the complex. Prometheus retaliates against the jack-priests; they scream and start seizing as if someone’s overloaded their implants. FATHER LÁSZLÓ, LET US SPEAK. GOD TO VERY SMALL MAN.<br>Outside, Attica grabs Crasher by the throat. “Who the hell was your target?” She threatens to dangle him out the hole he just made, and he starts to crack. He was forced to shoot—the person who hired him threatened to shut him completely down. We get the rest out of him by offering to remove the killswitch.<br>Crasher doesn’t know who hired him—describes him as “some woman”. By his description, it was Algol, Darius’ new head of security. Why she would want to shoot whoever he shot—he only had targeting information. George comes up to do a scan, and says, “I know who he shot… it’s Darius.”<br>Inside, Prometheus continues. I BELIEVE THAT FATHER LÁSZLÓ KNOWS THE CHURCH’S SECRET. DO YOU WISH TO TELL THEM, OR SHALL I?<br>László shrieks, “You can’t! You cannot! You must not!”<br>DO YOU NOT BELIEVE THE TRUTH IN THE MACHINE? AM I NOT THE VERY INCEPTION OF YOUR GOD?<br>The bodyguards of the downed jack-priests start firing indiscriminately at the hologram. Two of them run right past Spider; she moves fluidly and takes them down to prevent them from shooting into the crowd. Similarly, Gloria fires on another bodyguard, incapacitating them. Kes goes after a fourth; she can’t get through his armor. He howls, “HERETIC!” and gets a hit in on her. Calamity spins and cuts loose with her shotgun, taking out one of a pair; his buddy fires off a short burst and nails Calamity right back.<br>Outside, Graves is picking up some other speech, competing with the Church’s propaganda stream. It’s Reality Black; she’s saying some fairly standard violent jackass rhetoric—in the name of the workers, they’re going to liberate AusTex. They’re in the process of adding Reagent 18 to the water supply. Reagent 18 is a deadly neurotoxin—but it makes people violent and crazy before they die, or if they get a nonlethal dose. It’s a progressive condition with no cure. It’s the stuff that got sailed into New York Harbor, which was the reason they had to wall off Manhattan and several of the boroughs.<br>Plex security is putting people on the ground, and it’s about to turn into an all-out war between the Moderns and the Church, with Reality Black taking advantage of the chaos to poison the water supply.<br>Prometheus is arguing with someone—likely Reality Black. NO. YOU WILL NOT. THIS IS NOT WHAT WE AGREED ON. SHUTTING OFF WATER CONTROLS. <br>We’ve got to get to the water treatment plant; with the computer controls shut off, Black will need to access the water treatment plant directly. Moto gets us an underground route to avoid the war zone topside’s turned into so we can haul ass and try to intercept.<br>As we make our way through the tunnels, George reports a problem. There’s a Spire security patrol on the other side of the channel; if there’s a coup going on, no telling whose side they’re on. “Spread out, goddamnit! Find them!” Attica and Firefox work together to create a distraction, and dash past the guards into an industrial area. There’s another group farther on—members of the <a data-href="Texas Syndicate" href="factions\texas-syndicate.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Texas Syndicate</a>. They’re carrying military duffels.<br>We opt to continue the stealth approach: Graves moves up; one of the goons sees something, but Annika clouds his mind. Graves takes him down with a single suppressed pistol shot. Attica ghosts up and knifes her target in the neck, then throws his dead body over a ledge. Annika ceiling-crawls and takes out the third. Graves finds an improvised explosive and calls Kes to take a look—it’s not armed. It’s there to hamper pursuit or mess up the machinery, but we moved too fast. It’s unstable, and Kes doesn’t want to mess with it.<br>One of the hazmat guys is coming toward the door; we position ourselves. When the door opens, we move, and it’s a complete surprise. Gloria hits the lead hazmat guy with a 3-round burst, but the suit soaks up most of the damage. Spider jumps in and takes out the nearest gunman. Graves leaps in, uses the hazmat guy for cover, and hazmat guy throws off his aim. In a flurry of gunfire, Calamity and Kes manage to take down another Syndicate op. But there’s 2 more in the security office…]]></description><link>operations\collision-the-a-spire-job-part-4.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Operations/Collision - The A-Spire Job - Part 4.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2025 03:07:34 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[March 24, 2176]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br><br>There’s a number of interesting jobs out there, but the one we decide to go for is another one from <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Zero Ballard" data-href="Zero Ballard" href="people\zero-ballard.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Trust</a>: an extraction, of <a data-href="Terra McAllister" href="people\terra-mcallister.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Terra McAllister</a>. McAllister got a message to Ballard; she indicated she’d voluntarily remanded herself into their custody, and now they don’t want to let her go.<br>He says getting in to where she’s being held will be reasonably easy; getting her out will be more difficult. She’s currently in the hands of <a data-href="Cascadia Pro-Cop" href="factions\cascadia-pro-cop.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cascadia Pro-Cop</a>. It’s possible we’ll be able to extract her simply by waving some Wu around; Ballard’s not sure why exactly she’s in custody. She’s not at CPC headquarters; she’s been moved to a Pro-Cop black site. Ballard doesn’t know where the site is.<br>He suspects it’s near the HQ—somewhere near <a data-href="Bryker Woods" href="places\bryker-woods.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bryker Woods</a>, part of <a data-href="Old West (Austex West)" href="places\old-west-(austex-west).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Old West (Austex West)</a> Austin. The most likely possibility is right across the street, in an old building that used to be a state agency. The on-site security detachment is probably fairly small, since the HQ is available for fast reinforcement.<br>Attica gets herself inside as a temp worker, and the rest of the team observes from the outside. After a week’s worth of observation, the team manages to locate the tunnel between the HQ and the black site: right under the wall, parallel to the MoPac Transit Tunnel.<br><br><br>Attica overhears some of the cops talking about how they take overflow from HQ. When they want to interrogate people, they use VR. Also gets the name of the captain that runs the interrogations: Captain <a data-href="Quinn Jackstadt" href="people\quinn-jackstadt.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Quinn Jackstadt</a>.<br>It’s Graves that figures out where to look: the shower area, and Attica confirms it: a swing-down staircase that leads to something called Sector Five. We don’t yet know what it looks like, only that it’s underground and it’s guarded by sentry guns. The guards have IFF tags that let them pass. The sentry guns aren’t controlled from HQ; HQ can lock down the exit, but the guns are the responsibility of the black site.<br>The first password Moto creates triggers a security alert, and Pro-Cop is on edge. They’re expecting to be hit by the Hammers. And, learning from the mistake, Moto manages to make two much, much better passes; one for Attica and once for the evac team. It’s obvious why the Hammers would be getting ready to hit Pro-Cop; they’re going after McAllister. Graves does some info-digging, and finds out that <a data-href="Zoey Belmont" href="people\zoey-belmont.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Zoey Belmont</a> is also sniffing around. Belmont was the source of one of the jobs offered to us: looking for muscle for a snatch-and-grab. Her target is one of the top contenders for the top spot among the Panzers: <a data-href="Lucas Konstantin" href="people\lucas-konstantin.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lucas Konstantin</a>.<br>We tentatively plan to extract McAllister during the Hammer attack; in order to do that, it would help if we can sow some more chaos amongst the Hammers… we contact Belmont, offering our assistance with the Konstantin extraction. She offers his dossier, and notes that while we’re setting that up, she has a second extraction job waiting in the wings: <a data-href="Dr. Su Xinyi Zheng" href="people\dr.-su-xinyi-zheng.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dr. Su Xinyi Zheng</a>.]]></description><link>operations\slings-and-arrows-part-1.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Operations/Slings and Arrows - Part 1.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:00:51 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[April 1, 2176]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br><br>After some discussion, we conclude that letting the <a data-href="Panzer Hammers" href="factions\panzer-hammers.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Panzer Hammers</a> let loose with their attack isn’t a good idea. Best way to handle things is to go forward with the Konstantin extraction. Graves contacts a friend of his for some additional firepower: <a data-href="Annika Lovelace" href="characters\annika-lovelace.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Annika Lovelace</a>. She agrees in exchange for some help with a personal problem.<br><a data-href="Lucas Konstantin" href="people\lucas-konstantin.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lucas Konstantin</a>’s a greasy, paranoid son of a bitch. He hangs out at—and may be part-owner of—a vet bar called Bogey. Its symbol is the bogey on a tank; it’s a vet bar. Being a vet bar, it’s kind of insular; on the other hand, one of us is a vet. It’s not specifically a tanker bar, but it caters to them a little bit. Most of the local joygirls avoid the place; it’s all gangoons all the time. It’s the Panzer’s little clubhouse, complete with rooms for them to sleep it off.<br>Moto manages to tap into all the old copper laying under the black site, dating hundreds of years back to when the site was a State of Texas worksite.<br><br><br>We hit Bogey. The area around it’s surrounded by mines, and they’ve got a milspec high-band antenna on the roof. This isn’t their main base, just an outpost, but it’s a whole lot tougher a nut than we initially expected. The money gone into this suggests corpo involvement.<br>Attica helps talk George up to the antenna, and Moto’s able to tap into their comms. Beneath the camo tarps, there’s an assault aerodyne and a battle truck—a mobile command post. We’re able to use the storm sewers beneath to get into the bar beneath the sight of the Nazis. While we’re moving into position, Moto gets into the bar’s security system. He gets eyes on Konstantin—he’s upstairs, in a room, with <a data-href="Verner Jackstadt" href="people\verner-jackstadt.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Verner Jackstadt</a>.  And they’re on the phone with someone; Moto manages to eavesdrop on the call. <br>“Konstantin, I need you to do what we agreed on,” says the man on the other end. Moto identifies the man as <a data-href="Osric Kayne" href="people\osric-kayne.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Osric Kayne</a>, a member of the <a data-href="AusTex City Development Council" href="AusTex City Development Council" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">AusTex City Development Council</a>. He’s provided the Panzers the gear as part of an unholy union between Ms. Suvov with <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Koizumi Aerospace Corporation" data-href="Koizumi Aerospace Corporation" href="factions\koizumi-aerospace-corporation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Koizumi Aerospace</a> and AusTex. “I said I cannot and will not authorize and condone you rampaging from Bryker Woods through Military Heights to execute a jailbreak, I don’t care how valuable the target is. I am trying to negotiate.” Kayne’s plan is to have the Panzers clear everyone out to make room for a Koizumi manufacturing plant—specifically, one across from the Tesla Gigafactory. “Need I remind you, Verner, that we agreed to provide you with those resources to take care of the Vampire Nation, not to attack a duly bonded security company!”<br>Verner sounds bored. “Ja ja, we will do that, but my people are getting very impatient about Ms. McAllister. We will brook no further delay; you have 24 hours. Goodbye.”<br>That’s our cue to move. Spider takes two of the external guards out. Attica goes up into the ceiling; she doesn’t quite manage to grapple-kill the guard, but he panics and starts spraying bullets around. The Nazis are shocked; it gives us a precious moment of surprise. Attica takes out the netrunner; Gloria blows the rear axle of the battle truck into oblivion. Meanwhile, Annika sows discord in the form of a powerful wave of homoerotic attraction in the middle of a Nazi bar. Graves blows another Nazi all over his console, and Spider’s knives teach the panicked guard how to accessorize with his own blood.<br>The Nazis on the first floor run. Unfortunately for them, Moto changed the IFF on the mines… and their getaway becomes explosive. We manage to take Konstantin, though Verner gets away, both men threatening vengeance.<br>Belmont’s positively ecstatic. We managed to pull it off without any official heat, though the Panzers are now our mortal enemies. ]]></description><link>operations\slings-and-arrows-part-2.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Operations/Slings and Arrows - Part 2.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 04:20:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[April 6, 2176]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br><br>Final preparations are made, and we decide to sneak in through the tunnel from the abandoned admin complex. It comes out in a maintenance area beneath the airpad. Moto does his magic on the computer systems, pulling up the cameras on the maintenance area. He registers three clear heat signatures, and two more stealthed on the catwalk. <br>Attica sneaks forward to eavesdrop. The two on the catwalk are <a data-href="Quinn Jackstadt" href="people\quinn-jackstadt.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Quinn Jackstadt</a> and <a data-href="Isis Wakeman" href="people\isis-wakeman.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Isis Wakeman</a>; they’re arguing about an “upgrade” to the site’s defenses. Turns out they have something called an Eversor Walker—a light assault mech. It’s a bullet hose. Quinn’s pissed about it being there; since the Panzers are no longer going to be conducting their assault, there’s no reason for it to be there. (Quinn’s also not real happy about being in charge of the black site.)  The new construction we were worried about is apparently its storage facility.<br>To get to Sector Five, we need a small distraction; Moto brings up a small roach drone and starts fiddling with the VTOL. It starts making some very unpleasant sounding noises, like it’s got the electronic equivalent of epilepsy. That distracts the mechanics enough for us to sneak across to the Sector Five entrance…<br>We use our shiny fake passcards to get past the security booth when Moto pings us urgently. “Guys? Guys… they’ve rotated the keys…” Moto works fast to secure the turrets—just in case—while Firefox and Graves talk us through the gates. A coincidental? system malfunction works in our favor, and the security guards buy it. We’re waved on through; Moto’s still got control of the systems, and after a database search to locate our target, we move.<br>Unfortunately, there’s no predicting the human element. A cop steps out of the security office—the name of ‘Keefe’ on his uniform—and on seeing us, he steps back into the office. Alarms start going off. Graves flings a canister of crash foam at the office door, blocking it; Attica manages to break the electromagnetic lock into the VR cell block. Moto tries to make it look like a false alarm, but the cops aren’t buying it. Graves dashes down to jack in and start the wake-up process, while Attica jams the northern door. Calamity hears Jackstadt coming, and warns us in time for Moto to prevent them from locking down the elevator. Whoever’s on the northern door is about to break through; Firefox manages to weld it shut, while Attica heads to the other end of the corridor, tossing a gas grenade. Unfortunately, the first two responders have breathers and aren’t affected; they come out of the gas and hose Attica and Calamity down! Two more guards come out on the first floor, spotting Graves. Kestrel does her medical magic to jumpstart McAllister’s waking process.<br>Graves starts jacking out as Firefox steps out on the catwalk and lights on fire, snarling, “If you don’t want to get burned, get out of the way!” They don’t run, surprisingly; they start yelling “AMP! AMP!" They pull back, but in good order. Moto gives us our exit directions; Attica jams the sliding door between them and the oncoming Response team. Calamity takes one of Attica’s smoke grenades and tries to toss it down the corridor; it bounces and goes off… elsewhere.<br>One of their bots comes charging up, slamming into the jammed door; it doesn’t knock it down, but the grate is now a tangled mess.  The heavy weapons guy readies to fire HE on the door, while downstairs the response team rolls a SLAG grenade through the door. Moto opens the doors between us and the pad, and we begin a fighting retreat. Jackstadt’s directing an attempted intercept, while Pro-Cop’s own Amp throws a telekinetic bomb our way. We throw a little more crash foam for protection and make a break, as Moto seals the doors along the response team’s route. There’s still cops along our exit route, though, and they start shooting! It’s a clean miss, though—and Spider doesn’t give them a second chance! She rips through one of them, leaving him bleeding out, while Gloria rampages behind her—the remaining cops scatter while Attica seals the door behind us!<br>There’s only one obstacle left: the mech. George distracts it long enough for us to lay down Attica’s last two smoke grenades, and we make a run for the tunnel. The mech’s barely small enough to fit in the tunnel behind us—it simply lays down fire. It’s not terribly accurate; a few of us take some fragments, and Graves drops his last crash foam canister. We make it to Torrent without further damage, as George joins us. Calamity’s usual skill behind the wheel gets us out and merged into traffic, where we simply disappear.]]></description><link>operations\slings-and-arrows-part-3.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Operations/Slings and Arrows - Part 3.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2025 04:18:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Abel Kane]]></title><description><![CDATA[
